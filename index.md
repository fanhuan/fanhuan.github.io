I'm a Research Scientist/Bioinformatician at [WIL@NUS](https://wil-nus.sg/), a corporate lab between Wilmar International and National University of Singapore. I work on various sequencing-related projects, with a major focus on Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS).

I've always worked with high-throuput sequencing data. My PhD thesis at UW-Madison with [Dr. Tony Ives](http://www.zoology.wisc.edu/faculty/ive/ive.html) was on developing tools for analysing next-generation sequencing data without reference genomes, including phylogenomics and GWAS.

I have another PhD degree from Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden ([XTBG](http://english.xtbg.cas.cn/)), Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I worked with [Dr. Chuck Cannon](http://www.ecologicalevolution.org/), [Dr. Yann Surget-Groba](http://www.surget-groba.ch/start.php) and [Dr. Jin Chen](http://eepai.groups.xtbg.cn/) on the coevolution between fig and fig-wasps. XTBG is a tropical paradise and you should come visit sometime. 

I also did two Postdocs (I know. I am old). I started to work on microbiome during my first postdoc in the [Currie Lab](https://currielab.wisc.edu/index.php) in Department of Bacteriology in University of Wisconsin-Madison. My second postdoc was in the [Community Ecology and Conservation](https://www.communityecologyconservation.com/) group with Dr. Kyle Tomlinson at XTBG, where I worked on taxonomic classification from metagenomic data and host-associated microbiome. I also co-teach the Advanced Statistics Course with Kyle every summer on linear regression focusing on mixed models.
