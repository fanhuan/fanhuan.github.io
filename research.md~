## Long-term plant community dynamics
Ecosystems are increasingly affected by anthropogenic and natural disturbances which have profound influence on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Understanding how these disturbances affect plant communities has important implications for maintaining biodiversity and ecological processes, managing these communities, and projecting the response of plant communities to changing disturbance regimes. Yet long-term effects of disturbances on plant community assembly are still poorly understood, mainly because long-term baseline data regarding plant community composition is rare. Fortunately, in Wisconsin, we have excellent baseline data of plant communities because of the the carefully archived data from surveys conducted by J. T. Curtis and colleagues. 

I am using the unusually detailed baseline data from the 1950s to track changes in the over- and under-story composition of sand plain plant communities growing on sandy glacial lake bed sediments in central Wisconsin. 

## Past Research
####Species Evenness and Litter Decomposition
The following paragraph is the abstract of my Master's work.

  Climbing plants are increasing in dominance in the subtropical forests of South China and other areas around the world perhaps in response to shifts in climate and land use. These alter patterns of plant dominance and evenness more often than changes in species richness yet most prior biodiversity - ecosystem function studies have focused on the effects of species richness while holding abundance or biomass constant. Here, we report results from an experiment that tested how patterns of leaf litter evenness affected patterns of litter decomposition using mixtures of plant litter from two different functional groups (climbing plants and trees) in a subtropical forest in Guangdong, China. We found that species composition affected rates of decomposition the most. In addition, the evenness in leaf litter composition affects rates of decomposition, but that these effects depend on which plant functional group is dominant. When climbing plants were dominant, even mixtures decomposed slower  significantly than uneven mixtures. Evenness did not affect rates of decomposition, however, when trees were dominant. Decomposition rates increased in mixtures with higher proportion of climbing plants but there were negative non-additive effects of mixing litter overall. The magnitude of antagonistic effects increased with increasing dominance of climbing plants but decreased with time, suggesting a strong negative feedback between litter proportion of climbing plant and decomposition rates at the initial stage. Thus, shifts in which species is dominant and patterns of community evenness can greatly affect short-term decomposition processes.</p>
